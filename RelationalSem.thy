section {* What can Happen during a Contract Invocation *}

text {* This section defines a set of sequence of account states that can appeear during an
invocation of a countract.  The invocation can be a nested reentrancy, but we focus on one
invocation.  This means we do not look into details of further reentrancy, but just assume 
that the inner reentrancy keeps the invariant of the contract.  Of course we need to prove
that the invariant holds for the code, but when we do that we can assume that the inner
nested calls keep the invariants (we can say we are doing mathematical induction on the depth
of reentrancy).  *}

subsection {* Some Possible Changes on Our Account State *}

text {* The account state might change even when the account's code is not executing. *}

text {* During blocks, the account might gain balances because somebody mines 
Ether for the account.  The balance might increase also while other contracts execute
because they might destroy themselves and send their balance to our account.
The following relation captures this possibility.

such induction.}.
